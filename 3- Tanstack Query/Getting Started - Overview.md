# How React Query Can Simplify Your Data-Fetching and Caching

Data-fetching and caching are essential tasks for any web application that needs to communicate with a server. However, they are also complex and challenging tasks that require a lot of code and logic to handle correctly. In this article, we will introduce React Query, a library that can make data-fetching and caching a breeze for your web applications.

## What is React Query?

React Query is a library that simplifies data-fetching and caching for web applications. It helps developers deal with the challenges of server state, which is data that is stored on a remote server that can change without your knowledge. React Query offers many benefits, such as:

- Reducing the amount of code and complexity in your application
- Making your application more maintainable and easy to extend
- Improving your application's performance and user experience
- Saving on bandwidth and memory usage

React Query works out-of-the-box with zero configuration, but can also be customized to suit your needs.

## Why do you need React Query?

Most web frameworks do not have a good way of dealing with server state, which is different from client state. Client state is data that is stored on your device or browser and that you can control and manipulate. Server state requires asynchronous APIs to access and update it, and it can be changed by other people or processes without your knowledge. This makes server state management challenging and complex.

Some of the challenges that arise when dealing with server state are:

- Caching: Storing data locally to avoid unnecessary requests and improve performance
- Deduping: Avoiding multiple requests for the same data and using the same result
- Updating: Fetching new data from the server when the data is out of date or stale
- Knowing when data is out of date: Detecting when the data on the server has changed and invalidating the local cache
- Reflecting updates: Showing the latest data to the user as soon as possible
- Performance optimizations: Using techniques like pagination and lazy loading to fetch only the data that is needed
- Memory management: Cleaning up unused or expired data from the cache and freeing up memory
- Memoization: Reusing previous results of the same query with the same parameters

Most developers have not solved all or most of these challenges yet, and they end up building their own solutions or using general purpose state management libraries that are not designed for server state.

## How does React Query work?

React Query is based on the following principles:

- Server state is the source of truth: React Query assumes that the data on the server is always correct and up to date, and it tries to synchronize the local data with the server data as much as possible
- Queries are declarative: React Query uses a query function that returns a promise to fetch data from the server, and a useQuery hook to use the data in your components. You don't need to worry about how or when the data is fetched, cached, updated, or invalidated. React Query handles all of that for you
- Mutations are imperative: React Query uses a mutation function that returns a promise to update data on the server, and a useMutation hook to trigger the mutation and handle the result. You can also specify how the mutation affects the local cache and the queries that depend on it
- Devtools are essential: React Query comes with a built-in devtools that allows you to inspect and manipulate the cache, the queries, and the mutations. You can also see the status, the data, and the errors of each query and mutation

React Query provides many features and benefits, such as:

- Automatic caching and garbage collection: React Query caches the data that you fetch and removes the data that you don't need anymore
- Automatic refetching and background updates: React Query refetches the data when you mount, unmount, or focus your components, or when you reconnect to the internet. It also updates the data in the background when the data is stale or when the server data changes
- Automatic deduping and request cancellation: React Query dedupes multiple requests for the same data and uses the same result. It also cancels the requests that are no longer needed or relevant
- Optimistic updates and rollback: React Query allows you to update the local data optimistically before the mutation is confirmed by the server, and rollback the data if the mutation fails or is rejected
- Pagination and infinite queries: React Query supports fetching data in pages or in an infinite scroll manner, and provides helpers to manage the data and the pagination state
- Customizable cache and query keys: React Query allows you to customize how the data is stored and retrieved from the cache, and how the queries are identified and grouped
- Customizable fetch and retry strategies: React Query allows you to customize how the data is fetched from the server, and how the requests are retried in case of failure
- Customizable stale time and cache time: React Query allows you to customize how long the data is considered fresh or stale, and how long the data is kept in the cache
- Customizable query and mutation functions: React Query allows you to use any query and mutation function that returns a promise, and supports any data source or API
- Customizable suspense and error handling: React Query supports using suspense and error boundaries to handle loading and error states, and allows you to customize the behavior and the UI of these states

## How to use React Query?

To use React Query, you just need to define a query function that returns a promise, and then use the useQuery hook to fetch and display the data in your components. For example, you can use React Query to fetch the GitHub stats for the React Query project itself:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

// Define a query function that fetches the data from the GitHub API
const fetchProject = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    "https://api.github.com/repos/tannerlinsley/react-query"
  );
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
  }
  return response.json();
};

// Use the useQuery hook to fetch and use the data in a component
function App() {
  const { data, status, error } = useQuery("project", fetchProject);

  // Display the data, the status, and the error in the component
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>React Query GitHub Stats</h1>
      {status === "loading" && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {status === "error" && <p>Error: {error.message}</p>}
      {status === "success" && (
        <div>
          <p>Stars: {data.stargazers_count}</p>
          <p>Forks: {data.forks_count}</p>
          <p>Open issues: {data.open_issues_count}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
