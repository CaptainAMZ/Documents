# Client State and Server State in Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide

*By John Smith, Senior Web Developer*

In this article, I will explain the concepts of client state and server state, and how they are used and managed in web applications built with Next.js, a popular framework for React.

## What are client state and server state?

Client state and server state are two concepts that relate to how data is stored and manipulated in web applications. In general, **client state** refers to the data that is stored and manipulated on the browser, while **server state** refers to the data that is stored and manipulated on the server.

### Client state

Client state can include things like user input, UI state, cached data, and local storage. Client state is usually handled by libraries or frameworks such as React, which use a virtual DOM to update the UI based on changes in the state. Client state can also be persisted across sessions using cookies or local storage.

### Server state

Server state can include things like database records, session data, authentication tokens, and business logic. Server state is usually handled by backend frameworks or languages such as Node.js, which use APIs or server-side rendering to send data to the client. Server state can also be cached or invalidated using techniques such as revalidation or server actions.

## What is the difference between client state and server state?

The main difference between client state and server state is where the data is stored and how it is updated. Client state is stored on the browser and updated by the client, while server state is stored on the server and updated by the server. However, there can also be some overlap or synchronization between the two, depending on the architecture and design of the web application.

### Traditional web application

In a traditional web application, the server renders the HTML for the entire page and sends it to the client, which then updates the UI based on user interactions. In this case, most of the state is managed by the server, and the client only handles some UI state.

### Single-page application (SPA)

In a single-page application (SPA), the client fetches the data from the server using APIs and renders the UI using a library or framework such as React. In this case, most of the state is managed by the client, and the server only handles some data state.

### Server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG)

A hybrid approach is to use server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG), which pre-renders the HTML for the initial page load on the server and then hydrates the UI on the client using a library or framework such as React. In this case, the state is shared or transferred between the server and the client, and both can update the UI based on changes in the state.

## How does Next.js handle client state and server state?

Next.js is a framework that supports all of these approaches, and also introduces some new concepts such as React Server Components (RSCs) and Client Components, which allow developers to write components that can run on either the server or the client, depending on the context and the data requirements. Next.js also provides features such as App Router, which handles the routing and navigation between pages, and Server Actions, which allow the client to trigger mutations or revalidations on the server.

### React Server Components and Client Components

React Server Components and Client Components are a new feature of Next.js that enables developers to write components that can run on either the server or the client, depending on the context and the data requirements. This allows for better performance, lower bandwidth usage, and improved user experience.

- **React Server Components** are components that run on the server and stream the HTML to the client. They can access the server state directly, without using APIs or fetching data. They can also use server-side libraries or frameworks that are not available on the client, such as databases or file systems. React Server Components have the file extension .server.js.

- **Client Components** are components that run on the client and hydrate the UI. They can access the client state directly, without sending requests to the server. They can also use client-side libraries or frameworks that are not available on the server, such as animations or interactions. Client Components have the file extension .client.js.

Next.js automatically determines which components should run on the server or the client, based on the data requirements and the context. For example, if a component needs to access the server state, it will run on the server. If a component needs to access the client state, it will run on the client. If a component does not need to access any state, it will run on the server by default, unless it is explicitly marked as a Client Component.

### App Router

App Router is a feature of Next.js that handles the routing and navigation between pages. It allows developers to define the routes and parameters for each page, and also provides methods for navigating between pages programmatically.

App Router uses the file system to create the routes, based on the names and locations of the pages in the pages directory. For example, a file named pages/about.js will create a route /about, and a file named pages/blog/[slug].js will create a dynamic route /blog/:slug.

App Router also provides methods for navigating between pages programmatically, such as router.push and router.replace. These methods accept a URL or an object with the pathname and query parameters, and also support the shallow option, which allows for updating the URL without triggering a page change.

App Router also supports features such as prefetching, which loads the code and data for a page in advance, and fallback, which shows a loading state while the page is being rendered.

### Server Actions

Server Actions are a feature of Next.js that allow the client to trigger mutations or revalidations on the server. They are useful for updating the server state based on user actions, such as creating, updating, or deleting data.

Server Actions are functions that are defined in the actions directory, and have the file extension .action.js. They can access the server state directly, without using APIs or fetching data. They can also return a value or an error, which can be used by the client to update the UI or handle errors.

Server Actions can be called from the client using the useServerAction hook, which accepts the name of the action and the arguments. The hook returns a function that can be invoked to trigger the action, and also provides the status and the result of the action.

Server Actions can also trigger revalidation, which means that the server will re-render the page and send the updated HTML to the client. This can be done by setting the revalidate option to true in the action file, or by returning a revalidate property from the action function.

## Conclusion

In this article, I have explained the concepts of client state and server state, and how they are used and managed in web applications built with Next.js. I have also discussed some of the features and benefits of Next.js, such as React Server Components, Client Components, App Router, and Server Actions.

Next.js is a powerful and flexible framework that allows developers to create web applications that are fast, scalable, and user-friendly. If you want to learn more about Next.js, you can check out the official documentation or some of the tutorials and courses available online.
